### Layout

The layout of the webpage is achieved using CSS techniques such as:
- `Flexbox`: The Flexbox layout is utilized to create flexible and responsive layouts, arranging elements in a row or column.
- `Grid`: The CSS Grid layout is used to create a two-dimensional grid structure for precise positioning and alignment of elements.

### Colors and Typography

- Color Scheme: The project utilizes a carefully chosen color scheme to create a visually appealing and harmonious design. Colors are defined using color names, hexadecimal codes, or RGB values.
- Typography: Different font families, sizes, weights, and styles are applied to achieve a desired typographic style. Custom fonts may be included using `@font-face` rule or imported from external sources.

### Spacing and Sizing

- Margins and Padding: Proper spacing between elements is achieved by setting margins and padding using appropriate CSS properties.
- Element Sizing: The size of elements is controlled using properties like `width`, `height`, `max-width`, `max-height`, and `min-height`.


### CSS Classes and IDs

- Custom Classes: Custom CSS classes are used to target specific elements and apply unique styles.
- IDs: IDs are utilized for targeting specific elements with a unique identifier and applying specific styles or functionality.
